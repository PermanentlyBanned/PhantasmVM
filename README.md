# PhantasmVM

Welcome to the **PhantasmVM** – a virtual machine that exists purely in your imagination!

## Overview

- **No Hardware Required:** This VM doesn't run on any physical machine. It lives only in your brain.
- **Mental Projection:** Every time you want to start the VM, you must project it mentally.
- **Deep Concentration Commands:** Running commands requires intense focus. Lose concentration and – oops – the VM restarts!
- **Random Operating System:** The operating system is a figment of your imagination and changes randomly. Today you might be running "DreamKernel vX," and tomorrow it might be "MindOS Beta."

## How It Works

1. **Startup:** Start the VM by imagining it running in your head.
2. **Commands:** Type in your commands and stay focused. If you get distracted, the VM will spontaneously reboot.
3. **Random OS:** Every command execution might simulate a new OS flavor. Enjoy the unpredictability!
